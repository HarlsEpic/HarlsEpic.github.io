### Who am I

I am a student currently studying a **T-Level qualification in Digital Design and Development** at ***[Exeter College](https://exe-coll.ac.uk/)***.

### Things I enjoy

In my spare time, I enjoy playing videogames, reading books, programming and going for walks in the countryside.

### Programming Language

I am currently quite adept at using Python as a programming language, with some experience in HTML and CSS, and I am starting to learn C# as a language.

**Take a look at this website for a fictional sportswear business that I built using Python Flask, currently hosted on PythonAnywhere!**  -->  ***[Sportswear Direct](http://harlsepic.pythonanywhere.com/)***
